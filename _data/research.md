## Overview
I am a Professor of Software Engineering at Chalmers | University of Gothenburg.  
My work bridges research and practice with a focus on **software metrics & KPIs**, **AI in software engineering**, **empirical studies**, and **industrial/automotive systems**.

## Research Interests
- Software measurement: product & process **metrics/KPIs**, dashboards, and decision-support  
- **AI/ML in software engineering**: predictive models, quality & risk analytics  
- **Empirical software engineering**: large-scale industrial studies  
- **Automotive & embedded systems**: safety-critical development, continuous integration and verification  
- Evidence-based management of software organizations

## Teaching & Community
I teach and supervise across software engineering curricula (BSc/MSc/PhD), with a strong emphasis on **evidence-based practice** and collaboration with industry partners.
