## Research Areas & Representative Publications

### AI for Software Engineering
I explore how **artificial intelligence, especially generative AI**, can support and transform software engineering practice.  
My focus is on using AI for **automation, predictive analytics, testing, and debugging** in large-scale industrial contexts.

- **Exploring Generative AI in Automated Software Engineering** — *IEEE Software, 2025.*

### Software Architectures
I investigate the **design and evolution of large-scale software architectures**, with a special interest in **AI-enabled and automotive systems**.  
My research combines empirical studies with industry collaborations to understand how architectural choices affect quality and long-term maintainability.

- **Modeling and Architecting of Complex Software Systems** — *IEEE Software, 2024.*

### Software Metrics
A central thread in my work is the development and evaluation of **software measurement systems**.  
I study how **metrics and KPIs** can support **decision-making, process improvement, and quality assurance** in real-world industrial environments.

- **A framework for developing measurement systems and its industrial evaluation** — *Information and Software Technology, 2009.*  
  [Link](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=oMZ1ucgAAAAJ)  
- **Developing measurement systems: an industrial case study** — *Journal of Software Maintenance and Evolution, 2011.*  
  [Link](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=oMZ1ucgAAAAJ)

### Software Engineering in Medicine
I apply methods from **software engineering and AI** to the medical domain, especially for analyzing **time-series data** from healthcare systems.  
This research bridges **machine learning, medical informatics, and software engineering** to improve patient care and data-driven decision support.

- **Comparing Machine Learning Algorithms for Medical Time-Series Data** — *LNCS, 2024.*
